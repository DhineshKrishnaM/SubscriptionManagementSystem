The main library providing features that support the other parts of Spring Boot. These include:

The SpringApplication class, providing static convenience methods that can be used to write a stand-alone Spring Application. Its sole job is to create and refresh an appropriate Spring ApplicationContext.

Embedded web applications with a choice of container Tomcat.

First-class externalized configuration support.

Convenience ApplicationContext initializers, including support for sensible logging defaults.

## Liquibase

Liquibase makes it easy to define database changes in a format that's familiar and comfortable to each user and then automatically generates database-specific MySQL for you. Liquibase uses changesets to represent a single change to your database.

## OpenAPI (Swagger 3.0.3)

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
